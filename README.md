# PriCoSha (Private Content Sharing Application)

### Description
This project was the final project for my Introduction to Databases class at NYU Tandon. The product was broken down into four parts and this repository contains the final product. Below is the project guidelines.

### Project Overview
PriCoSha is a system for privately sharing content items among groups of people. PriCoSha gives users somewhat more privacy than many content sharing sites by giving them more detailed control over who can see which content items they post and more control over whether other people can tag content items with a userâ€™s personal information. You may choose the kind of content your version of PriCoSha focuses on, e.g. photos, video clips, announcements about social or professional events, etc. The focus of the
project will be on storing data about the content, allowing users to specify who can see and/or modify what, and providing ways for users to find content of interest. 

Your PriCoSha implementation should allow users to:
- login/register 
- post content items
- view content items that are public or that are shared with FriendGroups to which they belong
