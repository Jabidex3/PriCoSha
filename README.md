# PriCoSha
Private Content Sharing Application

This project was the final project for my database class at NYU Tandon, which was broken down into four parts. This repository contains the final product. Below is the project guidelines.

<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>The course project this semester is PriCoSha, a system for privately sharing content items
among groups of people. PriCoSha gives users somewhat more privacy than many content
sharing sites by giving them more detailed control over who can see which content items they
post and more control over whether other people can tag content items with a userâ€™s personal
information. You may choose the kind of content your version of PriCoSha focuses on, e.g.
photos, video clips, announcements about social or professional events, etc. The focus of the
project will be on storing data about the content, allowing users to specify who can see and/or
modify what, and providing ways for users to find content of interest. </p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Your PriCoSha implementation should allow users to log in, post content items, view content
items that are public or that are shared with FriendGroups to which they belong, and propose to
tag content items with usernames of other users, provided the content items are visible to both
the user (the tagger) and the person being tagged (the taggee), and manage tag proposals.
